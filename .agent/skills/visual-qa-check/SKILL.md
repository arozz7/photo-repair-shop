# Visual Verification Protocol
1. **Launch Browser:** Open the local dev server in the Antigravity Integrated Browser.
2. **Visual Audit:** - Check if buttons are aligned according to the design tokens in `RESOURCE.md`.
   - Verify mobile responsiveness by resizing the browser view.
3. **Proof of Work:** Take a screenshot of the final UI and include it in the chat for the user.
